worked on:
1. Basic CSS: I could potenitally work on implementing various libraries?
2. Project pages: They're fuctional but lack information.

Need to work on:
1. Pledges form: Initially under each project page i could see the number of pages made. But after I made changes to my backend and created new projects it would show. 
I also noticed that the projects in my Data.js file was different from my actual projects list. Could this be why I'm unable to see my pledges? I tried to ammend my data.js file with my current projects, 
but then my entire website broke. I also tried adding and removing some of my code (you can see this in my PledgeForm.jsx file. 
2. About section: I should work on an about section so people know what the site is actually about 
3. Making a project 
4. Creating a user
